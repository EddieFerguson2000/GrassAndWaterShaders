# GrassAndWaterShaders
This shows off my work with shaders in hlsl and glsl to make grass, water, and landscapes

Hopefully as simple as opening the project in visual studio and running it.
Everything in the Folder at GrassandWater/Grass/E10_GeometryGeneration/E10_GeometryGeneration was written by me except the code for noise.


code for the noise used in all my shaders found at https://github.com/keijiro/Museum/blob/master/Assets/Common/Shaders/SimplexNoise2D.hlsl
